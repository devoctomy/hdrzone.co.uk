# About Me

Welcome to the personal photography blog of Nick Pateman.  I am a Software Engineer by profession but one of my hobbies is photography, that's when I get teh chance to go out and take a whole bunch of photos anyway, which at the moment, hasn't been too often but I'm hoping to get out more this year.

## Hardware

At current I'm using a couple of devices, not majorly flashy, but as a DSLR I have a Nikon D90.  I primarily use a 35mm Nikon Nikkor prime lense as I love short focal length photos with shallow depth of field.  When I don't have my DSLR with me, I use my smartphone, previous incarnations of which have been a Lumia 1020, a Lumia 930, and now my Lumia 950.  It's difficult for me to say which was the best of the 3, the Lumia 1020's 41 megapixel 26mm lense camera was awesome, but it was also awfully slow, a problem that was fixed with the 930 and also introduced a customisable "rich capture" (HDR) mode which I loved, and the 950 has retained some of that, and made it even faster.

Either way, I do perform post-processing, simply to try and get best out of my work.

## Software

I use a couple of tools, those being,

Photoshop CC 2015
Photomatix Pro 5

Photoshop is used with all my photos, from basic RAW processing to colour tweaking, and Photomatix is used primarily for creating HDR photograhs as it's far superior to Photoshop in this field.  I'm not sure why Photoshop doesn't excel in all areas, but to be fair, you can download many add-ons, some of which are ridiculously expensive, Photomatix isn't.

## Blog

I won't go into masses of technical detail regarding this blog, it's using GitHub, Travis-CI, Jekyll and Amazon S3.  Basically all that means is, it's super fast, super cheap and much more productive for me, way more than my previous sites that have been a mission to upload sets to.
