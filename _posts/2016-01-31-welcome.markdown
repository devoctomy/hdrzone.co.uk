Welcome to the new home of hdrzone, the personal photograph blog of me, Nick Pateman.  Here you will find photography related blog posts as well as photo sets taken by myself whilst out and about.  If you would like to know more [about me](/about), check out the page I have for this purpose.

## Down But Not Out

It's been quite a while without a website since taking my previous one down which had many issues, too long to list.  Hopefully this new site / layout will provide a much better home for my photographs.

I am hoping to get a new photo set up later today, providing everything goes according to plan and I manage to fix the remaining issues with the site in time.  So much to do, so little time!

## Ideas For The Near Future

One idea I've had knocking about in my head is to do "themed" photo sets, so my first on this new site is going to be just that.  I'm going to pick something, maybe a colour, or a material, and take photographs that feature that.

So my first theme... "Metal"... Let's see how this goes.
